# Project Vision: MAIA God Mode

## Core Philosophy
- **Stack-Agnostic**: The agents adapt to the project, not vice versa.
- **Minimally Expensive**: High efficiency, low overhead.
- **Supercharged Workflows**: Automation where possible, strict verification where necessary.
- **Agentic Ecosystem**: Specialized agents (@maia, @coder, @ops, @researcher, @reviewer) collaborate seamlessly.

## Success Metrics
- Zero syntax errors reaching commits (caught by `@reviewer`).
- Clear, actionable plans before any code is written (enforced by `@maia`).
- One-command setup for new sessions (`/init`).
- Works on ANY project: Python, Rust, Go, TypeScript, Docker-only, or mixed.
