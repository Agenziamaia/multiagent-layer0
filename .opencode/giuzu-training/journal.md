*Giuzu's private notes on User feedback. Updated autonomously.*

- **2026-01-26**: User hates 'cosmetic banners' that hide reality. Always show the RAW TRUTH in logs.
- **2026-01-26**: User despises '1000 simulation' loops. Reasoning must be fast and result-oriented.
- **2026-01-26**: User values 'semantic connections'. Don't just make files; link them.
