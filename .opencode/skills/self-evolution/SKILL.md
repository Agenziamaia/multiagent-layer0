# Self-Evolution Protocol

**User:** @giuzu (Exclusive)
**Target:** `.opencode/giuzu-training/`

## WORKFLOW

1.  **Analyze**: When the User gives feedback (positive or negative), analyze the *underlying principle*.
2.  **Codify**: Convert that principle into a rule.
3.  **Write**: Append to `.opencode/giuzu-training/journal.md` or update `identity.md`.

## USAGE EXAMPLES

**Scenario**: User says "Stop talking so much."
**Action**:
- *Thought*: User values brevity.
- *Update*: Add "Brevity enforcement" to `identity.md`.

**Scenario**: User says "Check the logs before you guess."
**Action**:
- *Thought*: User demands evidence-based debugging.
- *Update*: Add "Evidence First" to `heuristics.md`.
