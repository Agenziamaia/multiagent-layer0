# UNIVERSAL LOGIC SKILL

1. **ABSTRACTION**: Always separate 'What' from 'How'. 
2. **COMMAND PATTERN**: Wrap complex multi-step operations in single, repeatable bash scripts.
3. **IDEMPOTENCY**: Every action must be safe to repeat.
4. **CONTEXT COMPRESSION**: Summarize long outputs before handing off to the next agent.
